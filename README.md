Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.6 or later**
- **pip** (Python package manager)

You can check your Python version by running:

```bash
python --version
```
## Setup
1. Clone repository
```
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install the dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up environment variable
Create a .env file in the root directory of your project and add your API token of GOREST by checking:
```
https://gorest.co.in/my-account/access-tokens
```
get the token, and replace your API_TOKEN in the .env file
```bash
API_TOKEN=your_api_token_here
```

Install allure for reporting purposes in your local device:

- For macOS (using Homebrew)
    ```bash
    brew install allure
    ```

- For Linux:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install allure
    ```

- For Windows:
  - Download the latest Allure Commandline zip from the Allure Releases page : [Allure Installation](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure2/releases)
  - Unzip the downloaded file and add the bin directory to your system's PATH environment variable.

After installing Allure, you can verify that itâ€™s installed correctly by running:
```bash`
allure --version
```
This command should display the installed version of Allure.

## Running Tests
Make sure you already have allure installed on your device, and run
```bash
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing --html=report.html --alluredir=allure-results -v src/test_api.py
```

## Viewing Test Reports
After running the tests, an HTML report will be generated as report.html in your project directory. You can open this file in your web browser to view the detailed test results.

Viewing Allure Reports
To view the Allure report, you need to have Allure installed. Once Allure is surely installed, you can serve the report with the following command
```bash
allure serve allure-results
```
This command will start a local server and open the Allure report in your default browser.
